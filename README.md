# GP_foams_predict
# Script to import a Gaussian processes model (pre-trained) to perform predictions on the foam density prepared in autoclave with three processing parameters: pressure, temperature and residence time. Simply add your three parameters in the input section below to get the predicted density.
## Paper: "Systematic copolymer screening for foaming experiments supported by computational methods", Journal of Materials Chemistry A, 2023 (in press).

### Instructions: Just save the *.pkl files and the .ipynb file to the same folder, choose your three parameters and execute the cell of the jupyter notebook file to get your prediction.
